**Project description:**
This is a Text only Game in Python where code has been written by ChatGPT using PromptEngineering commands in french (see text attached)
**Installation:**
Just run the program which is using a database of verbs which can be extended if need be. For 2024, I plan to have the 100 most used verbs (regular and non regular).
**Execution and usage:**
Project is currently version 0.1. Some more verbs and game options will be added
**Used technologies:** Program is written in Python and .uses TKinter for interface. I mainly used ChatGPT (the public free version to generate the code and improve portions of the code)
**Current features:**
- Choose a verb (regular/Irregular) 
- Choose a Tense (Present, Indefinido, Imperfect, conditional, future, subjonctive, imperative forms)
- Gain points and confidence in using spanish verbs
**Contributors:** My Spanish Teacher at Cervantes motivated me to improve my grammer mastery 
**Change log:** Version 0.2
**License:** MIT licence seems to be popular and really open.
